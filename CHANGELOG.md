## Unreleased

### New features

- Fuzz reproducers are now structurally minimized before being written — the minimizer removes irrelevant rungs, subroutines, instructions, branches, and conditions (including composite simplification) via delta-debugging, so saved reproducers are closer to the root cause.
- Tag-name strings are now optional — `Bool()`, `Int()`, `Real()`, `Dint()`, `Word()`, `Char()` infer their name from the assignment target, so `Foo = Bool()` is equivalent to `Foo = Bool("Foo")`. New typed block constructors (`IntBlock`, `BoolBlock`, `DintBlock`, `RealBlock`, `WordBlock`, `CharBlock`) provide the same inference for memory blocks — `DS = IntBlock(1, 100)` replaces `DS = Block("DS", TagType.INT, 1, 100)`. Existing code with explicit names is unaffected; when both are present and disagree, the explicit name wins and a `PyrungNameWarning` is emitted.
- DINT truthy conditions — `Rung(dint_tag)` now works the same as `Rung(int_tag)` (nonzero = true); Click validation catches both with `CLK_INT_TRUTHINESS_EXPLICIT_COMPARE_REQUIRED`.
- `rung` lowercase alias — `rung` is now the preferred spelling; codegen, examples, and docs updated to match (`Rung` still works).
- `__lock__` `joint` / `exclusive` input group keys — `input_groups=` renamed to `joint_inputs=`; new `exclusive_inputs=` parameter prunes mutually exclusive input combinations from the state space.
- `prove(paced=True)` — forces a stutter scan after any input change, suppressing violations that require back-to-back input flips with no settling time. When paced proves, an automatic aggressive second pass attaches `aggressive_counterexample` to the `Proven` result so you can see what only fails under adversarial timing.
- Prove agreement oracle — `pytest --prove-agreement` re-runs every `Proven` result with optimizations disabled to catch soundness regressions; opt out with `@no_agreement`.
- `prove()` explanation mode — pass `explain=True` to get a per-tag `Explanation` showing classification, domain inference, elision, and absorption decisions from each pipeline pass. Elision decisions now include proof detail (frontier path, observed set, retained/input/hidden dependencies, proof size) so misclassifications are diagnosable from the explanation alone.
- Known-answer reachability oracles — `pytest -m known_answer` now runs hand-enumerated `reachable_states()` tests for combinational logic, latches, one-shots, timers, counters, and interlocks so BFS has ground-truth coverage beyond differential fuzzing.
- Fuzz test duration is now configurable via `FUZZ_MAX_EXAMPLES` (programs generated, default 200) and `FUZZ_SCANS` (simulation steps per program, default 100/50).

### Breaking changes

- Verifier `depth_budget` rename — `max_depth` / `--max-depth` renamed to `depth_budget` / `--depth-budget` on `prove()`, `reachable_states()`, `check_lock()`, and CLI commands.

### Internal

- Interpreted runner now shares the same execution walker (`execute_program`) as the prover's traced elision, ensuring both paths agree on condition evaluation, branch and subroutine traversal.

### Performance

- `prove()` edge-source demotion — tags used in `rise()`/`fall()` whose exit value is scan-local (OTE or unconditional copy) are removed from the BFS state key; their previous-scan values are forwarded on transitions instead. This eliminates a state-key dimension per qualifying tag with no overapproximation.
- `prove()` 40–50% faster — cached `_read_names` walks, identity short-circuits in BFS hot paths, per-type store helpers in codegen, and reduced `isinstance` overhead across the BFS passes.

### Fixes

- `prove()` traced elision now recognizes inert-oneshot writes (copy, blockcopy, fill, calc with `oneshot=True`) as conditional — on scan 2+ the `guard_oneshot_execution` decorator skips the instruction, so the destination tag retains its entry value and must not be elided.
- `prove()` / `reachable_states()` soundness — traced elision no longer elides tags written by `out(..., oneshot=True)`, whose `_oneshot:` memory key carries cross-scan state that the backward-cone entry check did not cover.
- `blockcopy()` and `fill()` with indirect block ranges now set `fault.address_error` instead of crashing when the pointer resolves to an out-of-range address, matching `copy()` behavior.
- `prove()` / `reachable_states()` now preserve observable inert instruction targets such as `latch()`/`reset()` writes and can fast-forward monotone Real progress thresholds that gate off-delay timers, fixing missed reachable states in fuzz reproducers.
- Off-delay timer (`TOF`) initial Done state is now False when the enable condition has never been True, matching Click PLC hardware behavior.
- `prove()` / `reachable_states()` soundness fixes for timer/counter reset feedback — BFS now enqueues the base one-scan continuation alongside hidden-event jump branches, threshold absorption is blocked when the owner's reset condition transitively depends on progress state, consumed accumulators are excluded from scan-local elision, and helper reset/down conditions are modeled as rung-entry snapshot reads. Dynamic presets use the instruction-observed value (not the post-scan tag value) for hidden-event scheduling.
- `prove()` / `reachable_states()` soundness — subroutine writes now correctly depend on call-site conditions for scoped upstream queries (dimension classification and project slicing) via `upstream_slice_with_calls`, fixing wrongful elision of tags written inside conditionally-called subroutines.
- Fuzz-found verifier and calc fixes — `prove()` now retains internal tags used by `rise()`/`fall()`, preserves one-shot pulse counterexamples during pending settlement, `calc()` treats expression overflow as an out-of-range math fault instead of crashing, and generated fuzz reproducers preserve one-shot and calc variants.
- `prove()` threshold-progress settlement now preserves immediate counterexamples instead of replacing concrete post-scan states with hidden-event jump outcomes.
- `prove()` / `reachable_states()` soundness — `return_early()` guard conditions are now propagated to subsequent write-bearing rungs in the same subroutine, so upstream_slice discovers the control-flow dependency and keeps guard tags in the BFS state key.
- `prove()` soundness fixes — ten fixes for cases where `prove()` could return unsound `Proven` results, covering: timer/counter absorption when presets are external or trivially crossed at init, OTE classification in dynamic ForLoops and conditional subroutines, `receive()` destination absorption, and threshold vector handling for count-down/bidirectional counters and constant presets.
- `prove()` backward propagation expanded — ND input domains now propagate comparison boundaries through `fill()`, `blockcopy()`, invertible `calc()` (including `*`), transitive chains, and pointer-indirect writes, reducing `Intractable` results.
- `prove()` chained hidden-event settlement — cascaded timers/counters and threshold branches now settle fully before evaluating, preventing spurious counterexamples during transient progress.
- `prove()` stateful tag domain fallback — tags written by unsupported instruction types now fall back to `min`/`max`/`choices` metadata instead of returning `Intractable`.
- `prove()` counterexample trace fidelity — hidden-event traces report full concrete scan counts, and abstract threshold witnesses carry an explicit replay caveat.
- `prove()` auto-detects `receive()` destinations as nondeterministic without requiring `external=True`.
- `prove()` / `reachable_states()` now correctly explore timer/counter firing when the preset is a tag reference instead of a literal — previously the BFS missed the `PENDING→True` transition for dynamic presets.
- `prove()` now correctly explores drum instruction state transitions — BFS tracks `current_step` across scans, infers finite domains for drum outputs, and pairs the drum Done/Acc for tri-state treatment; truthy accumulator conditions (`Rung(timer.Acc)`) no longer drop threshold boundaries.
- `prove()` / `reachable_states()` now reach `Done=True` for edge-triggered `count_down` (and `count_up`) counters — the BFS event scheduler detects when the rung condition didn't fire during the event step and applies the missing accumulator delta.
- `prove()` now infers a finite domain for `search()` result tags from the block range bounds, so the result is tracked cross-scan and not lost during BFS deduplication.
- `prove()` / `reachable_states()` now mark nondeterministic timer/counter preset tags as always-live, fixing live-input pruning incorrectly classifying them as dead when they only appear in instruction data reads (not conditions).
- Oneshot `out()` writes False after firing instead of retaining the entry value, matching Click spec (both interpreted and compiled paths).
- Compiled kernel now expands `to_text` / `to_value` / `to_ascii` copy converters into sequential tag writes, matching Click's consecutive-register behavior and the interpreted engine.
- Compiled copy converters preserve address-fault classification for indirect source misses.
- Compiled replay now matches interpreted block tag materialization and same-block overlapping `blockcopy()` behavior.
- Interpreted PLC seeds subroutine-only tags at scan 0, matching compiled runner behavior.
- `forloop()` now rejects non-positive literal counts, while tag-based counts that resolve to zero or negative execute one iteration instead of skipping the body.
- Interpreted `forloop(..., oneshot=True)` now stores its one-shot latch in scan memory, matching compiled replay parity and keeping PLC state reproducible.
- Instruction memory keys (`_oneshot:`, `_shift_prev_clock:`, `_drum_*:`) now use stable sequential IDs assigned at program finalization instead of non-deterministic `id()` values, fixing interpreted/compiled parity mismatches and making serialized memory portable across sessions.

## v0.8.0 (2026-05-26)

Major overhaul of `prove()` and `reachable_states()`. Single-flip BFS, pre-BFS elision via abstract interpretation, accumulator absorption (threshold vectors and comparison-only), and a blockless compiled kernel mode (~8× faster steps) together make `pyrung lock` practical on industrial-scale programs that previously hit `Intractable`.

### Breaking changes

- Python 3.12 minimum — bumped from 3.11.
- Lock file default projection is now `lock=True` tags — programs using `TagMap` get physical outputs automatically; others need explicit `lock=True` or `__lock__ = {"include": [...]}`.
- Lock file omits False values — each state now reads as "what's ON"; `check_lock` handles both formats transparently.

### New features

- `lock` tag flag and `TagMap` auto-stamping — new `lock` flag includes tags in the default `pyrung lock` projection; `TagMap` auto-stamps `lock=True` on output-mapped tags and `external=True` on input-mapped tags, and `InputBlock` tags are automatically treated as nondeterministic.
- `band` tag attribute — predicate-based value grouping (`band={"ZERO": 0, "POSITIVE": "> 0"}`) collapses numeric lock file values into categorical labels.
- `__lock__` `joint` key — declares multi-flip input groups for BFS exploration of inputs that must change in the same scan.
- Lock file improvements — progress reporting with queue trend arrows, choice labels instead of raw integers, and `--profile` flag for cProfile output.
- `Intractable.hints` — dimension diagnostics listing the largest state-space contributors when `prove()` or `reachable_states()` returns `Intractable`.
- Pointer-default core validator — `CORE_POINTER_DEFAULT_BEFORE_BLOCK_START` catches the common 1-based block + `default=0` mismatch before runtime.
- Click `[choices=Bool]` shorthand — nickname CSV comments accept `[choices=Bool]` for int-backed boolean dropdowns.
- `UnpackToBitsInstruction.dest` / `UnpackToWordsInstruction.dest` — property aliases matching the `dest` convention used by all other packing instructions.
- New examples — `fill_station.py` (Physical annotations, Harness, `prove()` fault coverage) and `packml_bench.py` (industrial-scale profiling benchmark).

### Fixes

- `call("missing")` now fails at build time instead of compiling cleanly and crashing at scan time.
- Mixed-type values in lock file state sorting no longer raise `TypeError` when choice labels mix with raw integers.

## v0.7.0 (2026-04-26)

### Breaking changes

- Lock file default projection is now terminals — existing lock files generated with the old public-first projection will need regeneration with `pyrung lock`.

### New features

- `__lock__` module-level projection override — `__lock__ = {"include": [...], "exclude": [...]}` customizes which tags the lock file tracks beyond the terminal default.
- Public `Coupling` API on `Harness` — `harness.couplings()` yields `Coupling` dataclasses for iterating all discovered enable→feedback pairings.
- `plc.tags` read-only tag mapping — `MappingProxyType[str, Tag]` of all known tags by name for introspection and test assertions.
- `prove()` settle-pending semantics — `prove()` now settles pending timer/counter Done bits before evaluating, eliminating false negatives for properties guarded by timing.
- `SumExpr` CircuitPython codegen — `BlockRange.sum()` expressions now compile to CircuitPython code.
- Fault coverage example — new `examples/fault_coverage.py` demonstrating `prove()`, `cause()`/`recovers()`, and the coverage plugin.
- `TraceStep` dataclass for counterexample traces — enables accurate replay of timer/counter fast-forward edges.

### Fixes

- `prove()` domain coverage — boundary partitions now emit lit-1/lit/lit+1, property expressions feed into domain analysis, and memory-backed state is included in the visited-state key.

### Internal

- `_AnalogCoupling` renamed to `_ProfileCoupling` for consistency with the `Physical` API terminology.

## v0.6.0

### Breaking changes

- `PLC(history_limit=...)` replaced by `history` / `cache` / `history_budget` — three knobs replace the single snapshot-count parameter: `history` (retention window, e.g. `"1h"`), `cache` (instant-lookup window), and `history_budget` (byte ceiling, default 100 MB).

### New features

#### Declare — tag metadata and physical annotations

- Tag flags: `readonly`, `external`, `final`, `public` — three semantic flags enforced by static validators plus one presentation flag for Data View visibility, with mutual exclusivity enforced at construction.
- `choices` tag metadata — tags carry a `choices` mapping (value→label) through DAP traces, Click CSV round-trip, and VS Code debugger dropdowns.
- `Physical` annotations and autoharness — `physical=`, `link=`, `min=`, `max=`, `uom=` on tags declare device feedback behavior (bool timing or profile functions); `Harness` reads these and auto-synthesizes feedback patches, replacing hand-written test toggles.
- Click nickname CSV physical metadata — tag flags and physical metadata (`min`/`max`/`uom`) survive the nickname CSV export/import cycle.

#### Analyze — static validators, causal chains, and test coverage

- `Program.validate()` with `select`/`ignore` filtering — unified validation entry point with dialect, mode, and finding-code filtering.
- Static validators — stuck-bit detection (`CORE_STUCK_HIGH`/`CORE_STUCK_LOW`), readonly write, choices violation, final multiple-writers, and physical realism checks (`CORE_RANGE_VIOLATION`, `CORE_MISSING_PROFILE`, `CORE_ANTITOGGLE`).
- Runtime bounds checking — tags with `min`/`max` or `choices` are checked per-scan; violations populate `plc.bounds_violations` without clamping values.
- Static program graph analysis — `build_program_graph()` produces rung summaries, `TagRole` classification, and SSA-style def-use chains.
- `plc.dataview` — chainable query API with role/physicality filters, abbreviation-aware name matching, and dependency slicing (`.upstream()`, `.downstream()`).
- `program.simplified()` — resolves each terminal's condition chain back to inputs, eliminating intermediate pivots while preserving series/parallel topology.
- `plc.cause()` / `plc.effect()` — causal chain analysis attributing proximate causes vs enabling conditions, with projected mode for reachability queries and what-if analysis.
- Mixed-fidelity causal chains — recent steps use full SP-tree attribution; older steps fall back to timeline-based approximation when state is out of cache.
- `assume={}` on `cause` / `effect` / `recovers` — scenario-pinning parameter that overrides tag values for projected walks without mutating state.
- `plc.recovers(tag)` — convenience predicate: `True` if the tag has a reachable clear path from the current state.
- `plc.query` namespace — `cold_rungs()`, `hot_rungs()`, `stranded_bits()` surveys with `report()` for mergeable `CoverageReport` objects.
- Pytest coverage plugin — `pyrung_coverage` fixture collects per-test reports, merges at session end, with CI gating via TOML whitelist (`--pyrung-whitelist`).
- Digital twin test harness (`pyrung.twin`) — plain-English `case("sentence", ladder=fn, expect={...})` test slots with `assert_all_passed(results)`.
- Exhaustive state-space verification (`prove()`) — BFS over reachable states using the compiled kernel; returns `Proven`, `Counterexample` (replayable trace), or `Intractable`.
- Lock file workflow (`pyrung.lock`) — `write_lock()` / `check_lock()` serialize reachable states to JSON; behavioral changes show up as diffs in PRs.
- Unified `pyrung` CLI — `pyrung lock`, `pyrung check`, `pyrung dap`, and `pyrung live` commands.

#### Commission — VS Code debugger and live tooling

- Hot-reload (`reload`, `watch`, `unwatch`) — re-execute the program file preserving PLC state; `watch` auto-reloads on save.
- VS Code Data View — panel for watching, forcing, and patching tags with live inline values, flag badges, and public-only filtering.
- VS Code Graph View — interactive Cytoscape.js tag dependency graph with role coloring, upstream/downstream slicing, and live value badges.
- VS Code Chain tab — interactive causal queries (`cause`/`effect`/`recovers`) in the History panel.
- Debug console command system — typed command dispatcher with verbs for stepping, forcing, analysis, monitoring, and annotation.
- `pyrung live` CLI — attach to a running debug session from another terminal with semicolon-chained commands and session discovery.
- Session capture pipeline — `record`/`replay` captures replayable transcripts; a condenser shrinks to causal-minimum reproducers and an invariant miner proposes candidates that generate pytest verification files.

#### Infrastructure and DX

- Byte-budgeted recent-state cache — `history.at()` serves cached scans directly; older scans reconstruct via replay from the nearest checkpoint.
- Timeline-routed transition finding — `cause()`/`effect()` consult per-rung firing timelines before touching state, eliminating per-contact `history.at()` reads.
- Modern Click timer/counter codegen syntax — `ladder_to_pyrung()` emits positional presets and friendly unit strings.
- Type stubs for IDE inference — `tag.pyi` gives IDEs accurate type information for tag imports and `Block` fields.

### Performance

- Sparse scan log + compiled replay kernel — history records only nondeterminism (idle scans contribute zero bytes) and reconstructs older states via a compiled kernel operating on plain dicts instead of immutable `SystemState` objects.
- Reduced per-scan memory overhead — system points are derived at read time instead of written into the PMap each scan.

### Bug fixes

- Modbus `send`/`receive` latching semantics — status flags now latch on completion and persist across disabled scans, matching Click PLC docs; `conflicting_outputs` validator now covers send/receive status tags.
- Snapshot-stable instruction helper conditions — `.reset(...)`, `.down(...)`, `.clock()` and drum inputs now evaluate against the rung's frozen `ConditionView` instead of live mid-rung writes.
- Click subroutine export filenames — `LadderBundle.write()` preserves original filenames instead of slugifying them.
- VS Code webview script regressions — fixed template-literal escaping bugs; `make lint` now syntax-checks embedded webview scripts.
- Derived edge detection on system clock tags — `rise()`/`fall()` on derived tags now uses a derived-edge registry instead of the broken `_prev:*` fallback.
- `scan_counter` wraps at 32768 to match the Click SD9 spec.
- Send/receive I/O replay — scan log now records I/O events for correct state reconstruction during history replay.
- Sparse block-element commit semantics — only elements actually written during a scan are committed to state.

### Migration

- Replace `PLC(logic, history_limit=N)` with `PLC(logic, history="1h")`, `PLC(logic, cache="5m")`, or `PLC(logic, history_budget=bytes)` — or drop the argument entirely to accept defaults.

## v0.5.2 — Friendlier timer/counter API

### New features

- Positional `preset` and `unit` — `on_delay`, `off_delay`, `count_up`, and `count_down` now accept positional arguments: `on_delay(MyTimer, 3000)`, `on_delay(MyTimer, 5, "sec")`. Keyword form still works.
- Human-friendly time units — `unit=` accepts `"ms"`, `"sec"`, `"min"`, `"hour"`, `"day"` (and plurals, abbreviations). Default is `"ms"`. Tag-name suffixes `Tms`/`Ts`/`Tm`/`Th`/`Td` still accepted — `FillTimeTm` stays short, and `Tm` sidesteps the minute-vs-minimum ambiguity of `Min`.
- `DoneAccUDT` protocol — Timer/counter functions now type as `timer: DoneAccUDT` instead of `InstanceView | _StructRuntime`. IDE hover shows the contract, not the implementation.
- `normalize_unit()` exported — Converts any unit alias to canonical form. Available from `pyrung.core`.
- `TimeUnitStr` Literal type — All valid unit strings in one type for IDE autocomplete.

### Migration

- No breaking changes. Existing `preset=` keyword and `unit="Tms"` code works unchanged.

## v0.5.0 — Timer/Counter cleanup

v0.4.0 introduced `Timer` and `Counter` as built-in UDTs with `.named()` for creating instances. That was one special case too many — `.named()` is gone, replaced by `.clone()` which matches how the rest of the tag system works.

### Breaking changes

- `Timer.named()` / `Counter.named()` replaced by `.clone()` — `Timer` and `Counter` are now `count=1` singletons. Use `Timer.clone("Name")` / `Counter.clone("Name")` for named instances. TagMap auto-resolve for timer/counter operands removed — all mappings are now explicit via `.map_to()`.

### New features

- Section comments in TagMap codegen — `TagMap` constructor output now emits `# --- Structures ---`, `# --- Timers & Counters ---`, `# --- Blocks ---`, and `# --- Tags ---` section headers when there are 2+ non-empty groups.

### Migration

- Replace `Timer.named(n, "Name")` with `Timer.clone("Name")`. Same for `Counter`.
- Add explicit `.map_to()` calls for any timer/counter tags that relied on TagMap auto-resolve.

## v0.4.0 — Cleaner surface, honest abstractions

### Breaking changes

- `all_of`/`any_of` renamed to `And`/`Or` — PascalCase combinators replace the old function names. `&` and `|` operators removed for conditions (kept for math/bitwise). Comma inside `Rung(...)` stays as implicit AND.
- Built-in `Timer` and `Counter` UDTs — `Timer` and `Counter` are now built-in structured types with `.Done` (Bool) and `.Acc` (Int/Dint) fields, exported from `pyrung`. Use `Timer.clone("Name")` for named instances. User-defined UDTs with the same shape still work.
- Single-argument timer/counter instructions — `on_delay(timer, preset=...)` replaces `on_delay(done, acc, preset=...)`. Same for `off_delay`, `count_up`, `count_down`. The two-tag form is removed entirely.
- `PLCRunner` renamed to `PLC` — `.active()` removed; `PLC` is now a context manager directly (`with PLC(logic) as plc:`). `dt=` (default `0.010`) and `realtime=True` kwargs replace `set_time_mode()`. `dt=` and `realtime=True` are mutually exclusive. `TimeMode` removed from public exports.
- `set_battery_present()` replaced by property — use `plc.battery_present = False`.
- `plc.debug.*` namespace — 11 debugger-internal methods moved off `PLC` into `plc.debug`: `scan_steps`, `scan_steps_debug`, `rung_trace` (was `inspect`), `last_event` (was `inspect_event`), `prepare_scan`, `commit_scan`, etc. `system_runtime` accessible via `plc.debug.system_runtime`.
- Force API renamed — `add_force()` → `force()`, `remove_force()` → `unforce()`, `with plc.force(...)` → `with plc.forced(...)`. DAP debug console commands updated to match (`remove_force` alias removed).
- `_fn` variants dropped — `run_until_fn` merged into `run_until`, `when_fn` merged into `when`. Both now accept Tag/Condition expressions or callable predicates directly.
- `Program` internals privatized — `add_rung`, `start_subroutine`, `end_subroutine`, `evaluate`, `current` → private. Legacy `call_subroutine` removed.
- `TagMap` internals privatized — `offset_for`, `block_entry_by_name`, `owner_of` → private.
- Time units as strings — `Tms`, `Ts`, `Tm`, `Th`, `Td` removed from public imports. Use `unit="Tms"` string form. `TimeUnit` enum stays internal.
- Validation entry points consolidated — `validate_click_program` and `validate_circuitpy_program` removed from public exports. Use `logic.validate(dialect=...)` or `mapping.validate(logic)` / `P1AM.validate(logic)`.
- `Tag.__rand__` precedence guard — `int & tag` and `BoolTag & tag` now raise `TypeError` with guidance to reorder operands, preventing the Python operator precedence trap where `2 & tag` silently evaluates wrong.

### New features

- Conflicting output target validation — detects multiple `INERT_WHEN_DISABLED=False` instructions writing the same tag from non-mutually-exclusive paths, with condition-complement detection on caller conditions.
- Click timer preset overflow validation — `CLK_TIMER_PRESET_OVERFLOW` warns when a preset exceeds the INT range for its time base.
- `P1AM.validate()` convenience method — mirrors `TagMap.validate()` for CircuitPython programs.

### Bug fixes

- Click bypassed imported contacts — codegen now warns on contacts that were bypassed during import.

### Docs

- System namespace section added to concepts (`system.sys.*`, `system.fault.*`, `system.rtc.*`).
- Operator precedence trap callout added to conditions reference.
- Structured timer (`@udt`) note added to timers/counters reference.
- Click timer preset INT cap table added to Click dialect docs.
- Counter/timer accumulator switched to positional form in reference.
- Fault flags named explicitly in math reference.
- `ScanContext` section rewritten without internal type name.
- System points cross-referenced from runner guide.

### Migration

- Replace `all_of(...)` with `And(...)`, `any_of(...)` with `Or(...)`. Remove `&` / `|` between conditions — use `And()` / `Or()` or commas.
- Replace `on_delay(done, acc, preset=...)` with `on_delay(timer, preset=...)` using a `Timer` instance. Same for `off_delay`, `count_up`, `count_down` with `Counter` instances.
- Replace standalone `Bool`/`Int`/`Dint` timer and counter tags with `Timer.clone("Name")` / `Counter.clone("Name")`. Access `.Done` and `.Acc` fields on the instance.
- Replace `PLCRunner` with `PLC` everywhere. Replace `runner = PLCRunner(logic); ctx = runner.active()` with `with PLC(logic) as plc:`.
- Replace `runner.set_time_mode(TimeMode.REALTIME)` with `PLC(logic, realtime=True)`.
- Replace `plc.set_battery_present(False)` with `plc.battery_present = False`.
- Replace `plc.inspect(rung_id)` with `plc.debug.rung_trace(rung_id)`.
- Replace `plc.add_force(...)` with `plc.force(...)`, `plc.remove_force(...)` with `plc.unforce(...)`, `with plc.force(...)` with `with plc.forced(...)`.
- Replace `plc.run_until_fn(fn)` with `plc.run_until(fn)`, `plc.when_fn(fn)` with `plc.when(fn)`.
- Replace `on_delay(..., unit=Tms)` with `on_delay(..., unit="Tms")`. Same for `Ts`, `Tm`, `Th`, `Td`.
- Replace `validate_click_program(logic)` with `logic.validate(dialect="click")` or `mapping.validate(logic)`.
- Replace `validate_circuitpy_program(logic, hw)` with `logic.validate(dialect="circuitpy")` or `hw.validate(logic)`.

## v0.3.1

### Bug fixes

- Tag defaults now seeded into initial state — tags are populated with their declared defaults at construction time, fixing a disagreement between `Tag.value` and rung condition evaluation for tags with non-False defaults.

### Docs

- Expanded and polished "Know Python? Learn Ladder Logic" tutorial — added ASCII diagrams, adversarial exercises, cross-lesson callbacks, NC naming conventions, and aligned all lesson examples with the Click conveyor reference.
- `pyrung.zen` — `import pyrung.zen` prints guiding principles for ladder logic in Python (à la `import this`).

### Examples

- Conveyor examples (`click_conveyor.py`, `circuitpy_conveyor.py`) updated to follow tutorial naming conventions and best practices.

## v0.3.0

### Breaking changes

- `system.storage.sd.save_cmd` removed — use `board.save_memory_cmd` (`from pyrung.circuitpy import board`).
- `generate_circuitpy(...)` now supports optional `runstop=RunStopConfig(...)` and board-only (zero-slot) codegen.
- `calc(...)` no longer accepts `mode=` — mode is inferred from referenced tag families.
- `send()`/`receive()` now use `ModbusTcpTarget` dataclass instead of inline `host`/`port`/`device_id` kwargs.
- Codegen API cleanup — `TagMap.to_ladder()` removed; use `pyrung_to_ladder(program, tag_map)`. `csv_to_pyrung()` renamed to `ladder_to_pyrung()`.
- Copy modifiers replaced by copy converters — `copy(as_value(source), target)` is now `copy(source, target, convert=to_value)`; all `as_*` functions, `CopyModifier`, and `pad=` removed.
- Search uses comparison expressions — `search(DS.select(1, 100) >= 100, ...)` replaces the old `condition=`/`value=`/`search_range=` form.
- Block slot API replaced — `rename_slot()` etc. removed; use `block.slot(addr)` which returns a `SlotView` with `.name`, `.retentive`, `.default`, `.comment` properties.

### Moved

- `send_receive` module moved from `pyrung.click` to `pyrung.core.instruction`; re-exported from `pyrung.click` unchanged.

### New features

- History time-travel slider — scrub across retained scan snapshots in the VS Code debug sidebar with live tag value updates.
- Raw Modbus TCP and RTU support — `send()`/`receive()` accept `ModbusAddress` for raw register access to any Modbus device, with new `ModbusRtuTarget`, `RegisterType`, and `WordOrder` types.
- `BlockRange.sum()` — `DS.select(1, 10).sum()` returns a `SumExpr` for use in `calc()`.
- Click ladder CSV export — `pyrung_to_ladder(program, tag_map)` generates deterministic CSV files importable into Click programming software.
- Click ladder semantic-loss guard — round-trip now fails loudly on mismatched objects or lossy conditions instead of silently dropping them.
- In-memory round-trip — `ladder_to_pyrung(bundle)` accepts a `LadderBundle` directly for program → ladder → Python source without disk I/O.
- Multi-file project codegen — `ladder_to_pyrung_project(source)` generates `tags.py`, `main.py`, and `subroutines/*.py` from Click ladder CSV, with nickname-based name substitution.
- `immediate()` wrapper — immediate I/O reads in contacts and coil targets, with Click validation for direct-only contacts and `Y` bank coils.
- `TagMap.tags_from_plc_data()` — converts a PLC data dump into logical tag values for initializing a runner.
- Click nickname CSV round-trip improvements — marker-only boundary rows and block-slot address comments now round-trip correctly.
- Empty rung preservation — empty and comment-only rungs survive Click ladder CSV round-trip via `NOP` emission.
- Bare text safeguard in codegen — raises `ValueError` on unrecognised bare AF tokens instead of emitting undefined names.
- Rung comments — `comment("...")` attaches comments to rungs, exported as `#,<text>` rows in Click CSV.
- Nested branches — `branch()` inside `branch()` is now supported, all depths evaluate against the rung-entry snapshot.
- `Rung.continued()` — reuses the prior rung's condition snapshot for multiple independent wires on the same visual rung.
- CircuitPython Modbus TCP codegen — `generate_circuitpy()` accepts `modbus_server=` and/or `modbus_client=` for P1AM-200 Modbus TCP via P1AM-ETH.
- `write_circuitpy()` — convenience function that generates and writes CircuitPython output files in one step.
- Split CircuitPython codegen output — produces `code.py` (program) and `pyrung_rt.py` (shared runtime); pre-compiled `.mpy` available from GitHub releases.
- Crash-safe retentive persistence — CircuitPython retentive tags auto-save to SD card every 30 seconds with atomic rename.
- `named_array` instance API — `instance(i)` and `instance_select(start, end)` for accessing single or ranged instances.
- New examples — `circuitpy_traffic_light_modbus.py` (intersection controller with Modbus) and `circuitpy_retentive_runstop.py` (retentive tags with RUN/STOP).
- Starter project release assets — ready-to-import Click ladder CSV and CircuitPython bundles with pre-compiled `.mpy`.
- "Know Python? Learn Ladder Logic" tutorial — multi-lesson series with a conveyor sorting station example.

### Bug fixes

- OR topology corrections — four fixes for ladder CSV export that could silently corrupt OR branch wiring.
- T junction propagation — bridge topology now propagates correctly through T junctions in codegen.
- Named array stride — corrected stride handling for `count=1` named arrays in the Click collector.
- Analyzer graph reduction — fixed edge cases in the Click rung analyzer.

### Performance

- Faster round-trip program construction in codegen.

### Internal

- Expression class hierarchy replaced with data-driven `BinaryExpr`/`UnaryExpr`/`ExprCompare`.
- Module splits: `tag_map`, `context`, `send_receive`, and `codegen` each split into packages.

### Migration

- Replace `out(system.storage.sd.save_cmd)` with `out(board.save_memory_cmd)`.
- Replace `calc(..., mode="hex"|"decimal")` — mode is now inferred. Split mixed WORD/non-WORD math into separate `calc()` steps.
- Replace `send(host=..., port=..., device_id=...)` with `send(target=ModbusTcpTarget("name", "host"))`. Same for `receive()`.
- Replace `copy(as_value(source), target)` with `copy(source, target, convert=to_value)`. Same for `as_ascii`→`to_ascii`, `as_text`→`to_text`, `as_binary`→`to_binary`. Remove `pad=` — use string literals instead.
- Replace `search(condition=..., value=..., search_range=...)` with `search(range >= value, ...)`.
- Replace `block.configure_slot(addr, ...)` with `block.slot(addr).name = ...` etc.

## v0.1.0

Initial public release.

### Core engine

- Pure-function scan cycle with immutable `SystemState` snapshots (via `pyrsistent`)
- DSL: `with Rung()` context managers for readable ladder logic
- Instructions: `out`, `latch`/`reset`, `copy`, `calc`, `on_delay`/`off_delay`, `count_up`/`count_down`, `shift`, `search`, `fill`, `blockcopy`, `event_drum`/`time_drum`, `pack_bits`/`unpack_to_bits`, `pack_words`/`unpack_to_words`, `pack_text`
- Tag types: `Bool`, `Int`, `Dint`, `Real`, `Word`, `Char`
- Structured tags: `@udt()` for mixed-type structs, `@named_array()` for single-type interleaved arrays
- Blocks: `Block`, `InputBlock`, `OutputBlock` with configurable indexing
- Control flow: `branch`, `subroutine`/`call`, `forloop`, `return_early`
- Conditions: `rise()`, `fall()`, `all_of()`, `any_of()`, comparison operators
- Time modes: `FIXED_STEP` (deterministic, default) and `REALTIME` (wall-clock)
- Runner: `step()`, `run()`, `run_for()`, `run_until()`, `scan_steps()`
- Forces: `add_force()`, `remove_force()`, `with runner.force()` scoped context manager
- Patch: one-shot inputs via `patch()` or `.value` writes
- History: `runner.history.at()`, `.range()`, `.latest()`, configurable `history_limit`
- Time travel: `runner.seek()`, `runner.rewind()`, `runner.playhead`
- Fork: `runner.fork()` / `runner.fork_from()` for independent runners from snapshots
- Breakpoints: `runner.when(condition).pause()` / `.snapshot()`
- Monitors: `runner.monitor(tag, callback)` on committed value changes
- Inspection: `runner.inspect(rung_id)` for `RungTrace`, `runner.diff(scan_a, scan_b)`
