# DAP Debugger in VS Code

pyrung includes a Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) server that exposes PLC scan execution to VS Code.

## Features

- Source-line breakpoints
- Conditional breakpoints using the pyrung condition DSL
- Hit-count breakpoints
- Logpoints
- Snapshot logpoints with `Snapshot: label`
- Data breakpoints for monitored tags
- Monitor values in the Variables panel under `PLC Monitors`
- Custom debug events in Output channel `pyrung: Debug Events`
- Trace decorations and inline condition annotations

## Requirements

- VS Code with the Python extension
- `pyrung` installed: `pip install pyrung`
- The VS Code debugger extension from `editors/vscode/pyrung-debug`

## Launch configuration

Add to `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "pyrung DAP",
      "type": "pyrung",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${file}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Breakpoints

- Stop on a rung: click gutter
- Conditional breakpoint: right-click gutter -> Add Conditional Breakpoint
- Hit count: edit breakpoint hit count (fires on every Nth hit: N, 2N, 3N...)
- Logpoint: right-click gutter -> Add Logpoint
- Snapshot logpoint: set log message to `Snapshot: my_label`
- Logpoints and snapshot logpoints fire during both Continue and stepping commands.

Condition expressions use the pyrung DSL, for example:

- `Fault`
- `~Fault`
- `MotorTemp > 100`
- `Fault, Pump`
- `Running | (Mode == 1)`
- `all_of(Fault, Pump)`
- `any_of(Low, High)`

When you use `&` or `|` with comparisons, parenthesize the comparison terms:

- Valid: `Fault & (MotorTemp > 100)`
- Valid: `Running | (Mode == 1)`
- Invalid: `Fault & MotorTemp > 100`

## Monitors

Commands:

- `pyrung: Add Monitor`
- `pyrung: Remove Monitor`
- `pyrung: Find Label`

The status bar shows `M:<count>` while a pyrung debug session is active.

Monitors appear in:

- Variables panel scope: `PLC Monitors`
- Output channel: `pyrung: Debug Events`

## Data breakpoints

After adding a monitor, you can set a data breakpoint from the monitored variable to stop when its value changes.

## Watch expressions

Use the VS Code `Watch` panel for read-only expression evaluation.

- Bare tag/memory names return the current raw value (`Counter`, `Fault`, `Step[CurStep]`).
- Predicate expressions return `True`/`False` (`Fault & (MotorTemp > 100)`, `Mode == 1`).
- Unknown names fail with an explicit error so typos are visible.

Watch evaluation uses the same visible state as the Variables panel during stepping, including pending mid-scan values.

## Debug console force commands

The Debug Console is command-only for force operations:

```text
force TagName value
remove_force TagName
unforce TagName
clear_forces
```

Use `Watch` for predicate evaluation.

## DAP to runner mapping

- Step Over / Into / Out: `runner.scan_steps_debug()`
- Continue: adapter continue loop over `scan_steps_debug()`
- Conditional source breakpoints: adapter expression parser + compiled predicates
- Monitor callbacks: `runner.monitor(tag, callback)`
- Snapshot labels: `runner.history.find(label)` / `runner.history.find_all(label)`
- Data breakpoints: monitor-backed change listeners

## Trace event

The adapter emits `pyrungTrace` after each stop with the current step and region evaluation details used by decorations.
