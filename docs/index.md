# pyrung Documentation

This site starts with generated API reference from source using `mkdocstrings`.
The goal is to provide a baseline we can iterate on during a documentation pass.

## Current focus

- Runtime and DSL primitives in `pyrung.core`
- Click integration utilities in `pyrung.click`
- Project examples in `pyrung.examples`
